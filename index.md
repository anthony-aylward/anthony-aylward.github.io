# Anthony Aylward (bioinformatics scientist)

## Education

- 2008-2012: B.S. Mathematics (College of Creative Studies), U.C. Santa Barbara
- 2013-2020: Ph.D. Bioinformatics & Systems Biology, U.C. San Diego

## Expertise

- High expertise in Linux and MacOS command line environments. Also capable of
working with Windows. I have acted as a primary system administrator for
my lab's computing resources over the past three years. See for example
my [collection of tools](https://github.com/anthony-aylward/memory_policy) for
managing memory resources on a CentOS system with several users, which
relies on my python packages [mutil](https://pypi.org/project/mutil/) and
[fancyprint](https://pypi.org/project/fancyprint/).

- High expertise with software tools for next-generation high-throughput DNA
sequencing data, including:
  * sequence alignment (e.g.
    [BWA](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net),
    [Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml), etc.)
  * variant calling (e.g. [GATK](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/))
  * post-alignment analysis (e.g.
    [picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/),
    [SAMtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net),
    [bedtools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), etc.)

- Experience with popular biological databases such as
[dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/),
[1KGP](https://www.internationalgenome.org),
[ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org),
[Roadmap](http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org),
[GTEx](http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org), 
[GWAS catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/), 
including working programatically with API's.

- High expertise in programming with Python for bioinformatics applications.
See my various packages on [GitHub](https://github.com/anthony-aylward),
including:
  * [chipseqpeaks](https://pypi.org/project/chipseqpeaks/)
  * [luciferase](https://pypi.org/project/luciferase/)
  * [tssenrich](https://pypi.org/project/tssenrich/)
  * [pydbsnp](https://pypi.org/project/pydbsnp/)
  * [pyhg19](https://pypi.org/project/pydbsnp/)
  * [py1kgp](https://pypi.org/project/py1kgp/)
  * [seqalign](https://pypi.org/project/seqalign/)
  * [coloc](https://pypi.org/project/coloc/)

- Moderate expertise in programing with Python for web applications. This
includes SQL (specifically SQLite3). See my personal extension to the popular
web framework [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), comprising
[ftscursor](https://pypi.org/project/ftscursor/) and
[flask-ftscursor](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-FTSCursor/). See also my
websites: [UCSD BISB Unofficial](https://ucsd-bisb.info/auth/demo)
([GitHub](https://github.com/anthony-aylward/ucsd-bisb-unofficial)) and
[OK-scope](http://okscope.info)
([GitHub](https://github.com/anthony-aylward/okscope))

- High expertise in programming with R.

- High expertise in statistical reasoning, drawing on 6 years of classroom
training in math/statistics (including undergraduate and graduate courses) and
further independent learning during graduate school.

- Deep domain knowledge of statistical genetics, functional genomics, and
molecular biology topics, especially as they relate to Type 1 and Type 2
diabetes (see Publications). I routinely generate data-driven hypotheses for
biological experiments such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, EMSA, reporter
assays... and interpret the experimental results.

- I have mentored/supervised undergraduate and/or medical school students
on both computational and experimental biology research projects. See for
example Andres Padilla & Griselda Ruiz's [poster](tcf7l2-nkx63-poster.pdf) for
the [ENLACE](http://graeve.ucsd.edu/ENLACE/) program at UCSD, or Yleia
Sanchez's [ENCODE project API tool](https://github.com/yleiaa/ENCODE).
