## Expertise

### Software / computing

- High expertise in Linux and MacOS command line environments. Also capable of
working with Windows. I have acted as a primary system administrator for
my lab's computing resources over the past three years. See for example
my [collection of tools](https://github.com/anthony-aylward/memory_policy) for
managing memory resources on a CentOS system with several users, which
relies on my Python packages [mutil](https://pypi.org/project/mutil/) and
[fancyprint](https://pypi.org/project/fancyprint/).

- Moderate expertise in programing with Python for web applications. This
includes SQL. See my personal extension to the popular
web framework [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), comprising
[ftscursor](https://pypi.org/project/ftscursor/) and
[flask-ftscursor](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-FTSCursor/). See also my
websites: [UCSD BISB Unofficial](https://ucsd-bisb.info/auth/demo)
([GitHub](https://github.com/anthony-aylward/ucsd-bisb-unofficial)) and
[OK-scope](http://okscope.info)
([GitHub](https://github.com/anthony-aylward/okscope)). I have also made
occasional contributions to the design and implementation of the
[Diabetes Epigenome Atlas](https://diabetesepigenome.org).

### Bioinformatics / statistics

- High expertise with software tools for next-generation high-throughput DNA
sequencing data, including:
  * sequence alignment (e.g.
    [BWA](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net),
    [Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml), etc.)
  * variant calling (e.g. [GATK](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/))
  * post-alignment analysis (e.g.
    [picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/),
    [SAMtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net),
    [bedtools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),

  * [betabernsum](https://pypi.org/project/betabernsum/) : Sums of beta-bernoulli random variables

- High expertise in programming with R and [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org) for bioinformatics and statistics. See my packages:

- High expertise in statistical reasoning, drawing on 6 years of classroom
training in math/statistics (including undergraduate and graduate courses) and
further independent learning during graduate school. I routinely advise other
graduate students and postdocs on statistical analysis questions. For a toy example, see [this memo](polytest-model.pdf) I once wrote to give a simple & brief explanation of a statistical model.

### Machine learning / data science

- Extensive study of machine learning methods as part of
[graduate course cirriculum](http://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/node/1135) and
independently. Familiar with time series analysis, Markov models, decision
trees, random forests, support vector machines, neural networks, etc. See
[this answer to a DREAM challenge](dream-als.pdf) that I wrote with a
classmate.

- Proficiency with [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org). See [this example](refflat_vignette.md)
(click [here](refflat_vignette.ipynb) to download the `.ipynb` file), which demonstrates my R package
[refflat](https://github.com/anthony-aylward/refflat).

### Biology

- Basic experience in an experimental lab setting, including maintaining equipment
such as freezers, pH meters, etc.

- Deep domain knowledge of statistical genetics, functional genomics, and
molecular biology topics, especially as they relate to Type 1 and Type 2
diabetes (see Publications). I routinely generate data-driven hypotheses for
biological experiments such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, EMSA, or reporter
assays, and interpret the experimental results.

- Experience with popular biological databases such as
[dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/),
[1KGP](https://www.internationalgenome.org),
[ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org),
[Roadmap](http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org),
[GTEx](http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org), and
[GWAS catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/), 
including working programmatically with API's.

- Held position of dkNET Fellow during a collaborative project between my lab
and [dkNET](https://dknet.org). I used the beta version of the
[Signaling Pathways Project](https://beta.signalingpathways.org/about/index.jsf)
to develop hypotheses for experiments concerning the function of genetic
variants at diabetes risk loci, such as [JAZF1](https://github.com/anthony-aylward/anthony-aylward.github.io/blob/master/jazf1-regulation.md),
for example.

### Mentorship

- I have mentored/supervised undergraduate and/or medical school students
on both computational and experimental biology research projects. See for
example Andres Padilla & Griselda Ruiz's [poster](tcf7l2-nkx63-poster.pdf) for
the [ENLACE](http://graeve.ucsd.edu/ENLACE/) program at UCSD, or Yleia
Sanchez's [ENCODE project API tool](https://github.com/yleiaa/ENCODE).
